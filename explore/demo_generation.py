Generation Demo: Structural Inverse Propagation.

Demonstrates the generation side of continuous mapping group:
  Forward: L0 --down--> L1 --down--> L2  (coarsening, feature extraction)
  Backward: L2 --up--> L1 --up--> L0  (structural inverse, reconstruction)

Core principles:
  - Structural inverse: shape preserved, not exact inverse (info loss)
  - Primitive isolation: active and passive channels are independent
  - Level isolation: each level has its own templates
  - Absolute locality: all operations are local

Zero dependencies: pure Python standard library only.
